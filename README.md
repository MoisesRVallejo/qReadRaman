# qReadRaman
The qREAD-Raman program is a computer tool that allows the analysis of Raman spectra acquired using a Horiba Raman spectrometer. The developed computer tool is divided into two stages: 1) spectral pre-processing and 2) spectral analysis. The tool uses different algorithms for data analyses and finally determines the health plant status.
